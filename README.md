# mongoServer
# My first NodeJS & MongoDB Server

This is the second part of nodejs and mongodb app server. We made mongo database for app server.

## Before we started we installed:
* MongoDb
* Robo3T (because of problems with robo3T I also used MongoDB Compass)
* Postman

# Running Locally
1. git clone https://github.com/Eskodevelop/mongoServer
2. cd mongoServer
3. npm install
4. npm start
Open http://localhost:5000/ and also use /students or /courses , and enjoy. :)

# Libraries, npm packages and third party plug-ins:
* body-parser
* express
* helmet
* lodash
* mongoose
* babel-core
* babel-loader
* babel-preset-env
* babel-preset-stage-2
* nodemon
* webpack
* webpack-cli
* webpack-node-externals

We added/installed lodash and mongoose in the previous nodeServer library in dependencies.
